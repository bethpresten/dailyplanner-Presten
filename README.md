Use:
A user has the ability to schedule or log the events of his/her work day. Time is color-coded based on whether it's in the past, present, or future.

Installation:
I built this application based on prior code that was provided by Trilogy. I hard-coded as few items as possible in HTML and attempted to dynamically create items within JQuery to practice those coding skills. The CSS elements provided were unaltered and were also helpful in building this application. In JQuery, I began the process with DOM elements and then went on to JS elements and then the event listener. After that, I concentrated on the moment.js and then data persistance and local storage.

Credits:
My classmates, BCS Bootcamp Spots, and my T.A. for helping me through this process.
